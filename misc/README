Brief algo
==========

0) quiz by topic, exam and errors are almost 3 different worlds

1) quiz and exam puts questions to error DB

2) quiz has a memory of the questions made in the "quiz by topic" mode.
In the quiz, every time a question is sent,
it's temporarily removed from the DB for that student
so that there are no questions duplicates you do exercises and exercises

3) errors of the exam are sent to error DB.

4) statistics use the error DB and stored somewhere the number
of exercises performed.

5) error review removes questions from error DB

6) exam removes questions from error BD

7) statistics of topics now, last week and last month
