This file contains tips for development.

How to use git flow to work with production and testing repos
-------------------------------------------------------------

1) clone release openshift repo
2) git flow init
3) git remote add test [testing openshift repo]
4) git fetch test
5) (you have to be inside develop branch) git branch -u test/master
6) git pull

now you have two tracked branches:
    master - production repo
    develop - testing repo

NOTE: set push.default=upstream to push from develop branch

How to push local branch to remote (upstream) master
----------------------------------------------------

    git push <remote> <local branch name>:<remote branch to push into>

Example:

    git push test feature/name:master
